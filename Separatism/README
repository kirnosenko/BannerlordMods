Separatism
==========
Another solution for snowballing and any other sort of expansion.

The mod makes it a bit harder to build a big kingdom, because clans show their disloality in very obvious way.
Any clan may raise a rebellion depending on their relations with kingdom ruler, culture and owned fiefs.
When clan rebels it will found a new kingdom which will be at war with original faction.
In addition the mod sets free the ruler clan of any destroyed kingdom so that clan may join another faction.
